<h1>Assembler Features</h1>
</center>
The assembler offers a number of features to eliminate complexity in 
programming in Java bytecodes:
<ul>
<li><b>Automatic generation of binary .class file</b>
<p>
The assembler reads in an ascii file written in a <a href="jasm.html">
Java assembly language</a> and automatically tracks code lengths and attribute
counts.  The assembler then generates a binary .class file that conforms to 
the <a href="http://java.sun.com/java.sun.com/newdocs.html#JVM">Java Virtual
Machine specification</a>.
<p>
<li><b>Automatic generation of constant pool</b>
<p>
The Java assembly language provides no means of directly manipulating the 
constant pool.  Rather, operands that take constant pool offsets as arguments
instead take the contents of that offset as an argument.  
<p>
For example, the <b>new</b> operand in the Java VM Spec takes an index into 
the constant pool.  This index must point to a constant of type CONSTANT_Class,
which in turn points to a CONSTANT_Utf8 entry in the constant pool representing
the class's name.  Using the assembly language, a programmer need not deal
with the constant pool.  The instruction might simply state 
<b>new java.lang.Object</b>.
<p>
Since the assembler automatically generates the constant pool, the programmer
also doesn't need to wonder if he should use an operand like <b>ldc_w</b>
instead of <b>ldc</b>.  The assembler automatically outputs the proper 
command based on the size of the generated constant pool index.
<p>
<a name="localvar"><li><b>Named Local Variables</b>
<p>
The assembly language allows programmers to declare and use named local
variables rather than simply slot numbers.  Although programmers still have
the freedom to use slot numbers (and may wish to, in order to decrease the 
number of needed slots), named local variables offer a number of benefits.
<p>
When a local variable is declared (using syntax like <b>int MyInt</b> in the
code portion of a method), the assembler automatically allocates a slot number
to that local variable.  When that local variable is then used in an operation
(like <b>iload MyInt</b>), the assembler automatically substitutes the proper
slot number.  The assembler also tracks the count of <b>max_locals</b>
and enters that in the class file (unless the programmer provided a value for
<b>max_locals</b>).  Named local variables also make an assembly program
much easier to read, understand, and debug.
<p>
The programmer can also use the special operands of <b>load</b> and 
<b>store</b>.  These commands are not in the Java VM Spec, but provide for
easier programming.  Following the above example, if the programmer types
<b>store MyInt</b> the assembler knows that MyInt has a type of int and will
automatically generate the <b>istore</b> command with the proper slot number.
This might be particularly helpful in an assembly language class, since it
reduces the number of instructions a student needs to learn.
<p>
<li><b>Labels</b>
<p>
Since manually calculating byte offsets is disliked by most programmers, the
assembly language provides for use of labels to mark a position in a piece
of code. (In fact, the assembly language does not allow the programmer to 
manually calculate offsets.)
<p>
A label declaration should be an identifier followed immediately be a colon 
(with no space between the identifier and colon).  So one line of code might
read <b>MyLabel: istore MyInt</b>.  Later the programmer may include an
operation such as <b>goto MyLabel</b>.  The assembler will automatically 
calculate the offset to <b>MyLabel</b> and enter that into the code.  It will
also change the <b>goto</b> operand to <b>goto_w</b> if the offset is large
enough.  Thus the programmer need not worry about calculating the offset
or changing the operation based on the size of the offset.
<p>
Labels are used anywhere a code offset is needed.  This include commands such
as <b>tableswitch</b> as well as the exceptions, line number, and local 
variable tables which come at the end of a method.
<p>
</ul>
The assembler and its corresponding language provide a number of other features
(such as Java-like method and class declarations) which are fairly 
straight-forward.
