<h2>Overview</h2>
The Java Bytecode Assembler (or simply Assembler) is a program that converts
code written in "Java Assembly Language" into a valid Java .class file.  This
provides developers a simple means of either programming directly in Java 
assembly language or making Java bytecodes the target of a compiler.  It 
eliminates the need for developers to generate the constant pool, keep track 
of code lengths, calculate offsets, and perform other mundane tasks.

<ul>
<li>The <a href="jasm.html">Java Assembly Language</a> is similar to the 
output of Sun's <b>javap</b> utility, but also uses Java-like syntax 
to make it more readable.
<li>The assembler offers a number of <a href="features.html">features</a>
that ease programming in Java bytecodes.
<li><a href="examples.html">Examples</a> provide the best way to learn the
Java assembly language.
<li>The assembler can be <a href="download.html">downloaded</a> for 
educational purposes.
